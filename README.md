#Hololens sample

Very simple sample to demonstrate integration with Unity3d, UWP and Hololens.

Unity3d does not support (yet) the latest version of .net for scripting, but this is not an issue with UWP.

This project demonstrates how to enable this by using the [Origami sample](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/holographic/holograms_101e) from the 101e on Holograms by Microsoft,
and adding an script in which we will get the latest blockNumber.

##Video sample
This video provides a quick overview of the structure, #pragmas and dlls necessary on the plugins folder.
